README
========
This is a readme file for my first repositiry on Github. It's nothing really, just some text I've been asked to write.
It's always nice if the text has at least two lines to it, that way if you're not really going to read what's actually written here it still looks like there's something written here and that its important. Or absolutely not - in this case :)
